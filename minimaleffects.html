        The evidence for Presidential campaigns' influence on election outcomes
        is weak. Sorry if you spent a lot of time picking your policies!
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Minimal Effects Model, so much is already
        baked into the Presidential contest that campaigns have little impact on
        how people vote (<a

      <p>
        Most election outcomes are determined by fundamentals such as partisan
        loyalties, the incumbent president's approval rating, and economic
        growth. Since you've already won your party's nomination, voters during
        the November Presidential election assume you're a reasonable candidate.

        <!--incumbent's net approval rating-->
        <p>
          This model predicts the two-party popular vote based on 3
          variables:<br />
          <ol>
            <li><em>Incumbent President's popularity (NETAPP).</em> Measured by net approval rating at midyear. (Approval rating subtracted by disapproval rating). Positive net approval means their approval rating was higher.</li>

            <li><em>The state of the economy (G2GDP).</em> Measured by the annualized growth of real GDP in the 2nd quarter of election year.
            </li>

            <li><em>The time the
              incumbent party has been in office (TERM1INC).</em> Presence (1) or absence (0) of a first-term incumbent in the race</li>

              
          </ol>
          The output of the model produces <em>V</em>, which is the incumbent
          party's share of the two-party presidential vote, and <em>A</em> is a
          constant (in 2016, A was 47.26):

            src="model.png"
            style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid black"
          /><br />Thus, since the model calculates the incumbent party's share
          of the vote, the incumbent party is often disadvantaged in open-seat
          elections, since TERM1INC is 0. Hence the name "Time-for-change" ðŸ˜„.
          <br /><br />
          On average across 6 elections from 1992 to 2008, the model missed the
          final results by only 1.7 percentage points.<br />

        However, this doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the November Presidential
        campaigns donâ€™t matter. A small percentage of undecided voters in swing
        states can still shift the outcomes of the election because of the

        <h3>Electoral College</h3>
        <p>
          In the US, the Presidency is won through the Electoral College system,
          which allots electoral votes to the 50 states based on population
          size.<img src="electoralcollege.png" style="width: 100%" /> Most
          states (48/50) use a winner-take-all approach where the candidate that
          wins the most votes in that state gets <i> all </i> of its electoral
          votes. Maine and Nebraska use a district-based system that allows
          their electoral votes to be split. In order for a candidate to win,
          they must secure 270 of the 538 electoral votes. Thus, most campaigns
          focus on battleground states, rather than Democratic or Republican
          strongholds. Since most states follow a winner-take-all approach, this
          also means that Presidents can win the electoral college without
          winning the popular vote, which is the total number of votes cast by
          voters nationwide.

        Additionally, when there are large discrepancies in campaign funding and
        resources, campaigns can have a greater effect.
